#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n)
There is just 1 loop

b) O(n^2)
There is for loop within for loop thus making this operation expansive and slow


c) O(n)
By using recursive programming, we divided and conquered small parts of the problem until the entire problems is solve.

## Exercise II

Find the middle floor by splitting the length of the amount of stories in the building

Drop an egg if it breaks, go down one floor, drop another egg

     if the egg does not break, subtract the dropped eggs(plus one) from the middle floor, this will return floor f.

     else if the egg does break, repeat step a

Run time complexity is O(n)
